# Gastronomicon (WIP)

A Slimefun addon that adds even more foodstuffs to the game. Best used along with [ExoticGarden](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ExoticGarden).

## Gameplay

(WIP)

<!-- ### Workstations

#### Culinary Workbench

The Culinary Workbench has 9 slots for ingredients, and a row for tools. It has both shaped and shapeless recipes.

#### Multi-Stove

The Multi-Stove has a slot for fuel, while the electric version uses energy. Their recipes are both shapeless.

### Distillery

The Distillery should be kept in a dark environment (light level < 5) in order to produce high quality brews -->
