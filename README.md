# Gastronomicon - WIP

A Slimefun addon that adds even more foodstuffs to the game. Best used along with [ExoticGarden](https://github.com/TheBusyBiscuit/ExoticGarden).

## Gameplay

### Food, food, and more food

Recipes for most food items don't actually appear in the guide, but they can still be crafted if you know how. Experiment and go wild!

### Workstations

#### Culinary Crafting Table

The Culinary Crafting Table has 9 slots for ingredients, and a slot for tools. It has both shaped and shapeless recipes.

#### Brick Oven / Electric Oven

The Brick Oven has a slot for fuel, while the electric version uses energy. Their recipes are both shapeless.

### Tempered Pot

The Tempered Pot must be placed on top of a fire, campfire, or their soul equivalents. It must be periodically refilled with water.

### Distillery

The Distillery should be kept in a dark environment (light level < 5) in order to produce high quality brews
